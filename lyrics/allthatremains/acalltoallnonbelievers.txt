Dominate subjugation the end 
Decimate destruction is the real trend 
Fabricate enemies as your friends 
Profligate worthless is life in the end 
 
I know your false God 
I've seen his works and his deeds 
Your Angry False God 
And violence is his creed 
 
A call to all non-believers 
This is a call 
A call to stand up and fight 
Stand Fight 
A call to all non-believers 
This is a call 
A call to stand for what's right 
 
Demonstrate show just how backwards you are 
Calculate all while you hide in plain sight 
Perpetrate deception stealing of rights 
Subjugate no longer hiding the fight 
 
I know your false God 
I've seen his works and his deeds 
Your False God 
And violence is his creed 
 
A call to all non-believers 
(A call to all non-believers) 
A call to stand up and fight 
Stand, Fight 
A call to all non-believers 
(A call to all non-believers) 
A call to stand for what's right 
 
You have their blood on your hands 
Wash their blood from your hands 
Don't leave their blood on your hands 
Wash their blood from your hands 
 
This is a call to all non-believers 
This is a call to stand up and fight
