You loved me for all the wrong reasons 
There's nothing but pain left here I know 
What's killing me is that I'm killing you 
 
Three years of torment and torturous love 
Stained with tears and mistrust, enough is enough 
I can't hold you any longer in this hell I'm in 'cause 
Your heart is too weak for me to break it again 
All the mistakes I've made... 
You forgave, what the fuck? You shouldn't have drank! 
You'd always said "there's so much love in you" 
I can't believe that you can't see that 
 
You loved me for all the wrong reasons 
I'm not the same as I used to be 
There's nothing but pain left here I know 
What's killing me is that I'm killing you 
 
Do you remember the beginning? Heartbeats one and the same? 
Living smitten in Texas burning bright as a flame 
So young and in love, no care what anyone said 
'Til my soul grew cold and my heart turned dead 
What went so wrong with me? Why did I break this? 
Why was I so blind and fucking dumb to see that we were perfect 
'Til I turned around and gave in to debauchery 
This is your chance to escape this, my goodbye with a last kiss 
'Cause I know deep down you know that 
 
You loved me for all the wrong reasons 
I'm not the same as I used to be 
There's nothing but pain left here I know 
What's killing me is that I'm killing you 
 
You loved me for all the wrong reasons 
I'm not the same as I used to be 
There's nothing but pain left here I know 
What's killing me is that I'm killing you 
 
What's killing me 
(It's killing me, it's killing me) 
Is that I'm killing you 
 
What's killing me 
(It's killing me, it's killing me) 
Is that I'm killing you
