Bang! 
Explosions in my head that just won't quit 
A train has crashed into the wall around my heart 
And left the old me dead, obliterated. 
 
Stop! 
My breathing in the night when you're not there 
The silence ringing through my ears 
And all I want to do is hear your voice 
But you're not there 
 
Drawn together 
Painters brush stroke 
Sleight of hand we, 
We won't go up in smoke 
Fates colliding 
Love undying 
 
 
Like the rising tide 
Beating hearts grow but never die 
To simplify 
I'll stand by your side 
Close my eyes 
Hope will never die 
 
 
 
Go! 
And take away the pain of being me 
Soothe my soul, caress my heart 
And end my fear, all my bad memories 
Eradicated 
 
Ring! 
Like gunshots heard against the silent night 
My love is louder than these words. 
They're stronger than the rest, unstoppable 
Unstoppable 
 
Drawn together 
Painters brush stroke 
Sleight of hand we, 
We won't go up in smoke 
Fates colliding 
Love undying 
 
 
 
DIE... 
 
Drawn together 
Painters brush stoke 
Sleight of hand we, 
We won't go up in smoke 
Fates colliding 
Love undying 
 
 
 
DIE... 
 
Yeah...
